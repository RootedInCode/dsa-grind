## 🗓️ Day 19/6 – Mixed Topics (Stack, Search, Greedy)

### ✅ Problems Solved:
- [x] LC 150 – Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation *(Stack)*
- [x] LC 2294 – Partition Array Such That Maximum Difference Is K *(Greedy / Sorting)*
- [x] LC 33 – Search in Rotated Sorted Array *(Binary Search)*
- [x] LC 155 – Min Stack *(Stack design, tricky)*

### 💪 Wins:
- Understood Reverse Polish logic and stack mechanics
- Reinforced rotated array binary search pattern
- Learned practical greedy logic with array partitioning

### ⚠️ To Review:
- Practice rotated binary search again for edge cases
